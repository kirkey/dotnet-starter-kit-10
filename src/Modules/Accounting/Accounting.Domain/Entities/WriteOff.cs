/// <summary>
/// Represents a write-off of uncollectible receivables or bad debts, with approval workflow and journal entry tracking.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Use cases:
/// - Write off uncollectible accounts receivable as bad debt expense.
/// - Record collection adjustments and customer account corrections.
/// - Track reasons and approval process for write-off decisions.
/// - Link write-offs to original invoices and customer accounts.
/// - Generate appropriate journal entries for bad debt expense.
/// - Support potential recovery tracking if customer later pays.
/// - Enable aging analysis and collection effectiveness reporting.
/// 
/// Default values:
/// - WriteOffDate: current date (when write-off is initiated)
/// - WriteOffType: BadDebt (most common type)
/// - Status: Pending (requires approval before posting)
/// - Amount: required (amount being written off, must be positive)
/// - IsRecovered: false (becomes true if amount is later collected)
/// - RecoveredAmount: 0.00 (updated if partial recovery occurs)
/// 
/// Business rules:
/// - Write-off amount must be positive
/// - Cannot write off more than the outstanding balance
/// - Requires approval before posting to general ledger
/// - Must link to specific customer and/or invoice
/// - Bad debt expense account must be specified
/// - Write-off reduces accounts receivable balance
/// - Recovery reverses the write-off (fully or partially)
/// - Approval required for amounts above threshold
/// </remarks>
