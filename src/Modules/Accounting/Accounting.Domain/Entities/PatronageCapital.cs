/// <summary>
/// Represents a cooperative's patronage capital allocation and retirement for a member in a specific fiscal year.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Use cases:
/// - Allocate patronage capital to cooperative members based on their annual patronage (purchases/usage).
/// - Track capital credits accumulated by members over multiple years for equity accounting.
/// - Manage patronage capital retirements when the cooperative returns capital to members.
/// - Support cooperative financial reporting and member equity calculations.
/// - Enable regulatory compliance for cooperative capital structure requirements.
/// - Track partial retirements over multiple years based on board retirement policies.
/// - Generate member capital credit statements and retirement notices.
/// - Support estate settlements and membership transfers with capital credit tracking.
/// 
/// Default values:
/// - MemberId: required reference to member receiving the allocation
/// - FiscalYear: required year for the allocation (example: 2025)
/// - AmountAllocated: required positive amount allocated (example: 1250.00 based on annual patronage)
/// - AmountRetired: 0.00 (starts with no retirements)
/// - Status: "Allocated" (new allocations start as allocated)
/// - AllocationDate: date when allocation is recorded (typically end of fiscal year)
/// - RetirementDate: null (set when retirement begins)
/// - RetirementMethod: null (set when retirement policy is applied)
/// 
/// Business rules:
/// - AmountAllocated must be positive
/// - AmountRetired cannot exceed AmountAllocated
/// - FiscalYear must be valid (not future year)
/// - Cannot retire capital before board approval
/// - Retirement follows FIFO (first allocated, first retired) or board policy
/// - Member must be active to receive new allocations
/// - Estate transfers require proper documentation
/// - Tax reporting required for allocations and retirements
