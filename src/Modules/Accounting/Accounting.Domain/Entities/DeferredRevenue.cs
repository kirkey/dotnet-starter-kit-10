/// <summary>
/// Represents revenue that has been billed or received but not yet earned, to be recognized over time or at future dates.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Use cases:
/// - Track prepaid service fees collected in advance from customers.
/// - Manage subscription revenue recognition over contract periods.
/// - Handle customer deposits and connection fees earned over time.
/// - Support compliance with revenue recognition standards (ASC 606/IFRS 15).
/// - Enable proper matching of revenue with service delivery periods.
/// - Maintain accurate liability reporting for unearned revenue.
/// - Process systematic revenue recognition through automated entries.
/// 
/// Default values:
/// - DeferredRevenueNumber: required unique identifier (example: "DEF-2025-001")
/// - RecognitionDate: required future date when revenue should be recognized (example: 2025-12-31)
/// - Amount: required positive decimal (example: 12000.00 for annual prepaid service)
/// - Description: optional description (example: "Annual maintenance fee - ABC Corp")
/// - IsRecognized: false (revenue starts as unrecognized)
/// - RecognizedDate: null (set when revenue is actually recognized)
/// - RecognizedAmount: 0.00 (tracks partial recognition for multi-period deferrals)
/// 
/// Business rules:
/// - Amount must be positive
/// - RecognitionDate should be in the future for new deferrals
/// - Cannot recognize more than the original deferred amount
/// - Once fully recognized, no further changes allowed
/// - Supports partial recognition for multi-period deferrals
